# Dr. Rife’s transcript of the lost patent

## Situation analysis
It is well-known that bacteria, viruses (which includes cancer) and fungi can be devitalized and/or controlled by two frequencies (or if needed more → Typhoid and Tuberculosis).[1] Therefore in Dr. Arthur Isaac Kendall and Dr. Royal Raymond Rife studies they used a microscope that overcomes the resolution limit to be able to take pictures for example of the cancer virus.[2][3]

Furthermore, the patent of Dr. Rife and Mr. Thompson states that their invention enables the separation, transformation, control and extraction of minerals and chemicals from liquids, solids and gases.[4]

For a better reading, a transcript was taken of the patent, which is not easily accessible online.

Application # 512,326 MAY 31,1955

### [Page 3]
Our invention relates to the art of treating chemical substances, bacteria, virus, and fungi with electro-magnetic radiations and has particular reference to the means and process for separation, transformation, control, and extraction of minerals and chemicals from liquids, solids, and gases, and the devitalization and/or control of bacteria, virus, and fungi by exposing such substances to the concentrated radiation of electro-magnetic energy having specific and determinable frequencies.

This application constitutes a continuation in part of our copending application serial #512,326 filed May 31, 1955 for a PROCESS FOR THE SEPARATION OF CHEMICALS FROM LIQUIDS, SOLIDS, AND GASES AND DESTRUCTION AND CONTROL OF BACTERIA, VIRUS, AND FUNGI.

It is well known that all chemical compounds have an inherent natural resonant frequency, and that if such chemical compound is subjected to such resonant frequency of sufficient intensity its chemical composition or characteristics have been changed.

> -1- 

### [Page 4]
It is also well known that bacteria, virus, and fungi are, in essence, a chemical conversion plant and will survive only in given environment which supplies the proper and necessary food and that upon consumption of this food the virus, or bacteria produces deleterious chemicals which adversely affect the body. If sufficient of the virus are present to produce ??? sufficient of such deleterious chemicals, serious illness results. If the chemical composition or characteristics of the environment is changed sufficiently, or if the chemical by-product from the bacteria or virus is changed, the virus and bacteria become devitalized or destroyed and the harmful effect upon
the body is removed.
	
It is therefore among the objects of our invention to provide a means for producing electro-magnetic energy and of directing that electro-magnetic energy in a concentrated and directed beam to the locality of such virus, bacteria, or fungi being treated in order to destroy or change chemical characteristics or composition thereof.

Also one of the objects of our invention is to provide a means for the generation of a directed, concentrated beam of electro-magnetic energy and including means for varying or pre-selecting the frequency range for such electro-magnetic energy.

Students of bacteria and virus have long known

> -2-

### [Page 5]
that each different bacteria, virus or fungi has its own or individual and distinctive color range. The color range corresponds to, or is controlled by the chemical composition of the environment in which bacteria, virus or fungi resides.

We have found by experimentation that the resonant frequency required to the devitalize or destroy such bacteria, virus, or fungi or to affect the characteristics of the various chemical compounds being treated corresponds to the frequency range of the color of each bacteria, virus, or other chemical composition and that if such bacteria, virus, or fungi or chemical composition is subjected to electro-magnetic radiation having a frequency resonant with such color range and in sufficient intensity that the bacteria, virus, fungi or other chemical composition will be changed, devitalized,
or destroyed.

Also among the objects of our invention is to provide a process or method for treating bacteria, virus and fungi by first determining the color range thereof and subjecting such bacteria, virus and fungi to a relatively high intensity radiation of electro-magnetic energy having a frequency which is resonant with such color frequency or harmonic thereof.

### [Page 6]
A great deal of research and effort has been spent in recent years attempting to convert ocean or sea water into usable domestic water to increase the source thereof for our expanding population. Most of such efforts have taken the direction of mechanical separation of sodium chloride and other chemicals dissolved in the ocean water by means of evaporation and condensation. Large amounts of energy are required for this type of separation, which of a necessity, establishes a high cost for the usable water produced.

We have found by experimental usage that the sodium chloride and other chemicals can be remove from sea water by subjecting such sea water to radiations of electro-magnetic energy ?having?hac?frequency? resonant with the natural frequency of such chemical, or by chord of frequencies having such resonant and harmonies thereof.

We have established on numerous occasions that by subjecting such chemical radiations that the solution being treated will become stratified in that the various chemicals will settle to the bottom leaving substantially pure water to be removed from the top. It is therefore also among the objects of our invention to provide an apparatus for the continuous treatment of sea water in order to separate the dissolved solids therefrom in order to obtain relatively pure and usable water.

The processes above described cover a much

### [Page 7]
broader range of application to chemical transformation than the examples illustrated. The process herein specified of separation transformation, control and extraction of minerals and chemicals from liquids, solids and gases and the devitalization and/or controlled of bacteria, virus and fungi by subjecting, exposing, treating or processing such liquids, solids and gasses to a specific and determinable electro-magnetic frequency source which releases a vibrational energy coordinating with the critical energy level of the liquid, solid, or gaseous substances involved causes a transformation of such chemical constituents in such substance into an ionized or separable state. Such transformation produces a separable or soluble or partially soluble compound or ionized molecule which is capable of seeking its own level by settling or separation from the other liquids, solids or gasses by seeking its own level solution depending upon the specific gravity of the separable constituent or constituents involved. Thus, the separation, transformation and/or molecules thus stratified by a processes of sedimentation and/or filtration.

Other further objects and advantages of our invention will become apparent from the following specifications and the drawing illustrated thereof.

IN THE DRAWING:
Fig.1 is schematic representation of one of the preferred forms of our invention for treating
bacteria, virus and fungi.

Fig.2. is a schematic representation of a form of our invention for treating chemical compounds in solution.

The device illustrated and used in the practice of our invention for the treatment of bacteria, virus and fungi comprises essentially a frequency generator designated generally by numeral 10 of any well-known type. Such frequency generators are well-know in the art. We prefer a type having a broad range of generation and sufficient output capacity to produce radiation of sufficient intensity to render our processes practical.

The frequency generator 10 may be provided with some means such as control knob 11 for changing or varying the frequency output. Although it is not necessary it is sometimes preferred that the frequency range out-off should not be sharp so that a relatively wide band of the frequency spectrum can be radiated as desired.

Whereas any satisfactory means for controlling and directing the broadcasting of such electro-magnetic energy can be emplyed, we have found the most satisfactory

### [Page 9]
to be vacuum tube such as illustrated herein and which includes a glass envelop 12, an electronic gun 13, and a reflector or concentrator 14. The tube is also provided with external terminals 15 and 16 which are conductively coupled to terminals 17 and 18 of the frequency generator 10 by means of conductor 19 and 20.

The envelop 12 should be evacuated of all air and refilled with one of the inert gasses found in class “0” of the periodic tables to a pressure of approximately 14 millimeters of mercury. Where all the gasses found in class “0” will work, we prefer the use of helium as a filler for the evacuated tube because it results in a better definition of focusing of the beam and will stand up better under continuous use and bombardment.

In order to treat certain bacteria, virus or fungi so that they will be devitalized or destroyed it is first necessary to determine the color range of such bacteria, virus or fungi under a polarized microscope and then to set the control knob 11 of the frequency generator 10 to a segment of the frequency spectrum as published by Bureau of Standards which includes the known frequencies for the colors found for such bacteria, virus or fungi.

It has long been well-know that such maladies as cancer have been considered incurable and may prove fatal unless physically removed by surgery. It has also

> -7-

### [Page 10]
been well known by us that a specific virus causes the cancer growth.

We have observed by experimentation on cancer tissues removed from cancerous mice that the cancer virus can be destroyed by subjecting them to an intense radiation of electro-magnetic energy of a frequency range from 2000 to 2150 on a carrier wave of 4150 K.C. We not only have proved this by clinically growing cancer in mice and the subjecting them to such radiations which resulted in the curing of such cancer, but we have also observed the complete devitalization and destruction of cancer virus by subjecting such isolated virus to such radiation while observing their actual physical behavior under a light passing microscope of the type developed by Royal R.Rife and described in “The New Microscopes” by R.E.Seidel and M.E;izabeth Winter, Volume 237 No.2,
February, 1944, Journal of Franklin Institutes.

A great many other virus have been destroyed in the laboratory by subjecting them to radiations of
electro-magnetic energy of a frequency which is resonant with the lower harmonic equivalent frequency of such virus. A few virus, fungi and bacteria which have been treated and devitalized or destroyed and the frequency on a carrier wave of 4150 K.C. required for their destruction is set forth in the following table:

Referring now to Fig. 2 we have illustrated schematically one example of device for treating chemicals in solutions such as the removal of sodium chloride and other chemicals from sea water. The illustration herein shown includes a container designed generally by the numeral 20 containing the chemical solution 21. A plurality of frequency generators such as 22, 25 and 24 are provided for reasons which will be explained later. Each of the frequency generators are conductibly connected to terminal plates 25 and 26 by conductors 27 and 28 respectively.

Also a source of direct current such as the D.C. power supply 29 is connected to the terminal plates 25 and 26.

> -9-

### [Page 12]
Whereas we have found that impressing a resonant frequency on the terminal plates 25 and 26 from a single frequency generator such as 22 is effective in changing the characteristics of the chemicals in solution, we have also found that the use of the multiple frequency generators for the purpose of impressing several different frequencies forming harmonic chords is more effective to transform or change the characteristics of the chemicals in solution.

We have also found that polarizing or biasing the plates 25 and 26 by attaching a source of direct current to the plates also assists in the chemical processes.

We have observed that the solubility characteristics and chemical characteristics of certain chemicals can be changed by subjecting a solution thereof to the action of electro-magnetic energy corresponding to the resonant frequency of such chemical compounds. For example ordinary sea water was subjected to radiations having a frequency range from 120 C.P.S. to 30,000 C.P.S. and it was observed that the various chemical compounds disolved in water settled to the bottom in a stratified form corresponding to the specific gravity of the various chemicals and that the top portion of the water became sufficiently pure for domestic use. Filtration of the decanted portion may become necessary.
